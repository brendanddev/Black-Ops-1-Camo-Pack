# Black-Ops-1-Camo-Pack by Brendan

This repository features a collection of custom camos for Call of Duty: Black Ops 1 (Zombies & Multiplayer). 
Each camo includes both .dds and .iwi files, created or edited by me.

I plan to expand and refine this pack over time, improving existing camos and adding new ones!

## Contributions and Collaboration
- I’d love to work with other creators! If you're interested in contributing, whether by designing new camos, improving existing ones, or providing feedback, feel free to:
